[Theory]

Your tasks:

1. Createoneplayerarrayforeachteam(variables'players1'and 'players2')

2. Thefirstplayerinanyplayerarrayisthegoalkeeperandtheothersarefield players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players

3. Createanarray'allPlayers'containingallplayersofbothteams(22 players)

4. Duringthegame,BayernMunich(team1)used3substituteplayers.Socreatea new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'

5. Basedonthegame.oddsobject,createonevariableforeachodd(called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')

6. Writeafunction('printGoals')thatreceivesanarbitrarynumberofplayer names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)

7. Theteamwiththeloweroddismorelikelytowin.Printtotheconsolewhich team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.
Test data for 6.: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'. Then, call the function again with players from game.scored
